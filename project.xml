<!--
Used by zproject for:
 - generating files for cmake, automake, etc.
 - generating headers and source skeletons for classes defined in the api/ directory
 - generating headers for version, etc.
 - inserting license in files
 - and more?

To use, you need the GSL code generator
  git clone https://github.com/imatix/gsl.git
  cd gsl/src
  make
  make install

And the zproject specific specifications
  git clone https://github.com/zeromq/zproject.git
  cd zproject
  ./autogen.sh
  ./configure
  make
  make install

Then to regenrate config based on project.xml changes (or api changes..)
  gsl project.xml

-->
